I've just started reading the book No Place to Hide, by Glenn Greenwald. During the reading, I'll try to post here a summary of what I think is more important in each chapter. In the introductory chapter Glenn Greenwald talks about why he was chosen by Snowden to take care of publishing his revelations and also why the subject of the revelations should be important for everybody. Here goes a summary:

In 2005 Glenn Greenwald started a blog to discuss the radical and extremist theories of power the US government had adopted after 9/11.

A few months later, New York Times revealed that, since 2001, under orders of president George W. Bush, the National Security Agency (NSA) was spying on thousands of American Citizens without warrant.

US government tried to justify its decision using the excuse that because of terrorism the president should have the ppower to do anything necessary to keep the nation safe, including breaking the law.

This subject was a convergence of Gleen's passion and expertise and therefore he used the next two years covering every aspect of NSA's warrantless wiretapping scandal.

Because his work covering this matter, Snowden thought that Glenn would be a good fit to deal with the information he was about to leak.

This was not the first time that governments spied on their citizens without warrant, but because of the nature of Internet, it's now much bigger deal. Internet is part of every detail of modern life. It is where people communicate, make friends, choose movies, books, clothes, everything. A government capable of knowing habits and preferences of everybody can practically read people's minds.

Internet began with the promise that it would be a territory of individual liberation and political freedom. A place where people could be whoever they like without fearing opression. Currently it is the opposite of that. We need to decide how the Internet we want looks like and fight for it.
